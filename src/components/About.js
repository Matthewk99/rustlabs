                "Rust's world is harsh. Other players can find you, kill you, and take your stuff. Fortunately for you, you can kill others and take their stuff. 
                The environment is not kind. Wild animals will chase and kill you. Being exposed to radiation for an extended period will kill you. Starvation and exposure will kill you. 
                Or maybe you can make friends, help each other survive, and build your safe haven amongst the destruction."
